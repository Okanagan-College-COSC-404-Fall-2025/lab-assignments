      SQL Developer is a free tool provided by Oracle to create and work
      with an Oracle database.<br>
      <br>
      Later, you can visit this Oracle site for SQL Developer get an
      overview of SQL Developer's features.<br>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/technologies/whatis-sql-developer.html">https://www.oracle.com/tools/technologies/whatis-sql-developer.html</a><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Installing SQL Developer</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      If you plan on installing SQL Developer on your personal computer,
      you can download it from this site:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html">https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html</a></li>
      </ul>
      Just like when you installed the SQL Instant Client, you will need
      to sign in to your Oracle Account to get the appropriate
      downloads.<br>
      <ul>
      </ul>

      Developer</span><font size="+1"><big><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
      </big><br>
      Start SQL Developer. After a few moments, you should see a window
      that appears similar to the figure below. If you see the Configure
      File Type Associations dialog box, you can just click OK to
      dismiss it.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 624px; height: 511px;" alt="Figure 1" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab6Fig1.png"><br>
      <br>
      The area on your left shows the so-called connections that have
      been configured and saved to the current installation of SQL
      Developer. The connections shown in the figure will not be the
      same as those in the lab nor your personal installation. Likely,
      there will be no saved connections. You will need to add a
      connection configured to our <span style="font-weight: bold;">klo-cis-ora-1.okanagan.bc.ca</span>
      server for this to work for you.<br>
      <br>
      Note that each saved <span style="font-style: italic;">connection</span>
      is associated with a specific schema in a specific database. You
      can configure and save connections to many different databases on
      many different servers as long as you have a network connection to
      the server and you have the username and password associated with
      the schema on the database. <br>
      <blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember: Whenever
          you want to connect a personal computer to a server at
          Okanagan College, you will need to first connect to Okanagan
          College via your student VPN. IT Services must set up this
          account for you and is done at the request of your instructor.
          This should have been completed sometime during the first week
          of classes, if you didn't already have this VPN for some other
          reason. </span><br>

        Create a Connection to Oracle</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br>
      Before we can use SQL Developer with our COSC 404 database, we
      need to create a connection to the database. <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Right-click on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connections</span>
          and select <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Connection</span>
          from the shortcut menu.<br>
          <br>
          <img style=" width: 279px; height: 279px;" alt="Fig 2" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig2-SQLDev.png"><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">New / Select
            Database Connection</span> dialog box, fill in the fields as
          shown in the figure below. Be sure to use your Oracle server
          username and password (provided by your instructor) and
          provide a Connection Name that suits you.<br>
          <br>
          <img style=" width: 750px; height: 390px;" alt="Fig 3" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig3-SQLDevNewConnection.png"><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>If you are working from your personal computer remember that
          you have to open your VPN connection first.<br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>You can click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test</span>
          button to make sure a connection can be established. If a
          message appears indicating that the connection could not be
          established, open the <span style="font-weight: bold;">New /
            Select Database Connection</span> dialog box for the
          connection and verify the data that you entered. You can
          re-open this dialog box by right-clicking on the name of the
          connection and then selecting <span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Properties</span> from the shortcut list.<br>
          <br>
          <img style=" width: 750px; height: 389px;" alt="Fig 4" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig4-SQLDevConnectionSuccess.png"><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Remember to click Save so that your connection will be
          remembered.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Connecting to Your COSC 404 Schema</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Once a <span style="font-style: italic;">connection</span> has
      been configured and saved, you connect to your COSC 404 schema by
      double-clicking the name of the associated connection or by
      right-clicking the connection name and selecting <b>Connect</b>
      from the shortcut menu.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 259px; height: 257px;" alt="Fig 5" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig5-SQLDevConnection.png"><br>
      <br>
      After a few moments you will be connected and you will now have
      access to all the database objects in your schema. The figure
      below shows the SQL Developer window after connecting using the
      highlighted connection.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 659px;" alt="Fig 6" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig6-SQLDevSchemaView.png"><br>
      <br>
      You can see that there are numerous items listed for this
      connection starting with Tables followed by Views. If you click
      the plus symbol beside the Tables item. You will see a listing of
      all of the tables in this schema. Click the plus symbol beside
      tables. The image below shows 9 tables for the sample user.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 659px;" alt="Fig 7" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig7-SQLDevTables.png"><br>
      <br>
      I have copied the 8 of the 9 tables into your schema.<br>
      <br>
      To view details of </font><font size="+1"><font size="+1">the
        L4_EMPLOYEES </font>table you would click on the table.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 314px;" alt="Fig 8" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig8-SQLDevTables2.png"><br>
      <br>
      The details associated with columns for this table are shown (just
      like using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">desc</span>
      SQL*Plus command). In fact, once a table is selected, there are
      over 10 tabs you can select from that will show information about
      the table. The default selection is the <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">Columns</span> tab as shown above. Try clicking the next
      tab, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data</span> tab.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 388px;" alt="Fig 10" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig9-SQLDevTablesData.png"><br>
      <br>
      You see that this tab displays the data in the A4_EMPLOYEES table.
      You can also examine the constraints for this table, triggers and
      many other details.<br>
      <br>
      You should also notice that all of these detail tabs are residing
      on another tabbed page named for the table as shown below.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 248px;" alt="Fig 10" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig10-SQLDevTablesTabs.png"><br>
      <br>
      You can return to the original view of your connection by clicking
      the associated tab as shown below:<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 250px;" alt="Fig 11" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig11-SQLDevTablesOrigView.png"><br>
      <br>
      Notice that the area on this tabbed sheet has two tabs you can
      choose from - <span style="font-style: italic;">Worksheet</span>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;">Query Builder</span>. Be
      sure that <span style="font-style: italic;">Worksheet</span> is
      selected. The Worksheet area is like an editor area that you can
      use to develop queries. For example, look at the query created
      below. You can create your own.<br>
      <br>
      <img alt="Fig 12" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig12-SQLDevWorksheetTab.png"><br>
      <br>
      Once the query is created it is ready to run. All you need to do
      is click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run</span> button
      (circled in the above figure) to run the query and see the
      results. Click the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Run</span>
      button.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 528px;" alt="Fig 13" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig13-SQLDevWorksheetRun.png"><br>
      <br>
      The results of the query are displayed. You can remove the output
      by closing the Query Result table.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 528px;" alt="Fig 14" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig14-SQLDevWorksheetRun.png"><br>
      <br>
      You can write multiple SQL queries in the worksheet area. To run
      just one of them, highlight the query you want to run and click
      the run button as shown in the example below. (You can also run
      the highlighted query by pressing ctrl-Enter).<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 614px;" alt="Fig 15" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig15-SQLDevWorksheetRun.png"><br>
      <br>
      In fact, you can develop extensive scripts by sequencing a set of
      statements together in the worksheet area. To run the script (the
      entire worksheet area) you can click the Run Script button (or
      press F5).<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 903px; height: 927px;" alt="Fig 17" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig17-SQLDevWorksheetScript.png"><br>
      <br>
      To save your script into a file that can be run later, click the
      Save button.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 601px; height: 451px;" alt="Fig 18" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig18-SQLDevSaveScript.png"><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Dictionary</span><br>
      <br>
      You can explore the information stored in the data dictionary
      tables by browsing the various items in the navigation area. <br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 902px; height: 927px;" alt="Fig 19" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig19-SQLDevDataDictionary.png"><br>
      <br>
      For example, if you want to learn about the constraints that have
      been applied to a table, you can select the table in the
      navigation area and then click the constraints tab. No typical
      constraints should exist on the tables in your schema as they were
      put there without constraints, so you will not see the same things
      shown in the following image.<br>
      <br>
      In the figure below, you can see that the L4_ORDERS table has two
      named constraints - a primary key constraint and a foreign key
      constraint. <span style="font-style: italic;">ID</span> in the
      L4_ORDERS table is its primary key, and <span style="font-style:
        italic;">emp_id</span> in the L4_ORDERS table is a foreign key
      referencing the primary key, <span style="font-style: italic;">ID</span>,
      of the L4_EMPLOYEES table. The primary key constraint of the
      L4_EMPLOYEES table is a named constraint called L4_EMPLOYEES_PK.
      Notice that in the R_CONSTRAINT_NAME column of the foreign key
      constraint the L4_EMPLOYEES_PK constraint is shown.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 981px; height: 435px;" alt="Fig 20" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig20-SQLDevConstraints.png"><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Views</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      We have seen that the data dictionary stores text associated with
      a view in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">USER_VIEWS</span>
      table. You can access this text by selecting the view you want in
      the navigation area and then selecting the Details tab. You will
      notice that the text is stored as a value in one of the fields.
      However, it is not too readable. I haven't populated your schema
      with any views. If you want to experiment with this, you should
      create a view.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 981px; height: 399px;" alt="Fig. 21" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig21-SQLDevViewText.png"><br>
      <br>
      You can ask SQL Developer to generate the SQL statement that
      creates the view by clicking the SQL tab. If you try it with a
      view in your schema, after a few moments you will see the SQL
      statement for the view has been generated for you as shown below.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 981px; height: 400px;" alt="Fig. 22" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig22-SQLDevViewText2.png"><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Triggers</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I have not populated your schema with any triggers, so just read
      along in this section.<br>
      <br>
      Data dictionary information is also available regarding your
      triggers. Expand the Triggers item in the navigation area to list
      the triggers in your schema. You can click the various tabs to get
      information about the trigger selected in the navigation area. If
      you click the Code tab, you will see the PL/SQL code of the
      associated trigger, as shown in the image below.<br>
      <br>
      <img style=" width: 1038px; height: 673px;" alt="Fig. 23" src="./COSC 404 Lab 1 -SQL Developer and SQL Review_files/Lab9Fig23-SQLDevViewTriggers.png"><br>
      <br>
      As you can see, everything that you could do in the SQL*Plus
      Client environment, you can do in the SQL Developer environment.
      In fact, you can do much more in the SQL Developer environment.<br>
      <br>
      Use SQL Developer to browse around your schema to learn more about
      SQL Developer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disconnecting From Your Database</span><br>
      <br>
      To disconnect from your database right-click on your connection in
      the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Connections</span> pane. You
      should see a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disconnect</span>
      item on the shortcut menu. This lets you know that you are
      connected. To disconnect, just select Disconnect from the shortcut
      menu. You may be prompted to commit any uncommitted changes to
      your database as follows:<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Note About SQL Developer</span><br>
      <br>
      We have just scratched the surface of SQL Developer. It is a
      professional tool that can make working with and administration of
      an Oracle database much easier. <br>
